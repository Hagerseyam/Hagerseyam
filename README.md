I am a Software Engineer from Cairo, Egypt 🌍, passionate about building user-friendly, scalable, and efficient software solutions. With experience in frontend and backend development, I enjoy turning ideas into real applications that solve problems and improve user experiences.

Currently, I am expanding my skills in cloud computing (Azure ☁️) and exploring AI technologies to stay ahead in modern software development. I’ve worked on projects ranging from portfolio websites and e-commerce platforms to AI-powered interview tools like MetaHire.

I’m motivated by continuous learning, problem-solving, and collaboration. Whether it’s designing clean user interfaces, developing backend systems, or integrating APIs, I’m always eager to take on new challenges and grow as a software engineer. 🚀

📭 Reach out for help with: Web Development, Python, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git.
💬 Interests: Software engineering practices, emerging AI tools, and building meaningful digital experiences.
👾 Fun fact: I believe every project is a chance to both teach and learn something new.
