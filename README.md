I am a Software Engineer & Freelance Developer from Cairo, Egypt 🌍, passionate about building user-friendly, scalable, and efficient software solutions. With experience in both frontend and backend development, I enjoy turning ideas into real applications that solve problems and improve user experiences.
I’m a certified IBM Software Engineer 🎓 and currently working on more complex projects that go beyond the basics from portfolio websites and e-commerce platforms to AI-powered interview tools like MetaHire.

Right now, I’m expanding my skills in more complex projects and exploring AI technologies to stay ahead in modern software development.

🚀 What drives me:

-Continuous learning and problem-solving
-Collaborating on real-world impactful projects
-Writing clean, maintainable, and scalable code

📭 Reach out for help with: Web Development, Python, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git
💬 Interests: Software engineering practices, emerging AI tools, and building meaningful digital experiences
👾 Fun fact: I believe every project is a chance to teach and learn something new.
